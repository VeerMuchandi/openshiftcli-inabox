# Openshift CLI Shell In A Box

This repository uses shellinabox. This is ShellInABox+OpenShift Client tools. 

## Notes
* This Dockerfile uses RHEL-Atomic Image `registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7/rhel-atomic`
* You need a box with RH Subscription to be able to build this image. 
* All dependencies needed by openshift-cli are added to this image along with ShellInABox. ShellInABox comes from EPEL
* `/var/run/nologin` removed (moved) to allow user login
* shellinaboxd running with `--disable-peer-check` so that the connection is not reset every few mins due to container running behind a load balancer
* This container runs as root as you want to add additional users to this shell. So the openshift admin needs to provide `anyuid` access to the service account used to run this container.


## Deploying on OpenShift

Choose a password to login as user `guest` into the shellinabox
```
$ export MYPASSWORD=<<Your Guest Password>>
```

Give the `anyuid` access to the default service account:
```
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default
```

Deploy OpenShift CLI ShellInABox application.

```

    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:                 
     'oc expose svc/cliinbox'                                                                                                                
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
```

Expose the service to create a route

```
$ oc get svc                                                                                                            
NAME       CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE                                                                                     
cliinbox   172.30.123.236   <none>        4200/TCP   1m  

$ oc expose svc cliinbox                                                                                                
route "cliinbox" exposed                             

$ oc get route                                                                                                          
NAME       HOST/PORT                                 PATH      SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD                                  
cliinbox   cliinbox-occli.apps.devday.ocpcloud.com             cliinbox   4200-tcp                 None

```

Now you can use your route to access it from the browser.

Login using `guest` and password that you chose at the beginning. Run regular `oc` commands from command line.
